Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* test(skills): add importlib loader + FakeResp for skill tests

* test(skills): register loaded module in sys.modules; raise requests.HTTPError in FakeResp

* feat(image-generation): add MiniMax provider with env auto-detect

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* refactor(image-generation): guard unknown provider, derive ref MIME, strengthen tests

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>

* Potential fix for pull request finding 'Explicit returns mixed with implicit (fall through) returns'

Co-authored-by: Copilot Autofix powered by AI <223894421+github-code-quality[bot]@users.noreply.github.com>

* fix(models): strip inconsistent user-message names for MiniMax chat

DeerFlow middlewares tag user messages with provenance names (user-input, summary, loop_warning); langchain serializes them into the OpenAI-compatible payload and MiniMax rejects mismatched user-message names with "user name must be consistent (2013)". PatchedChatMiniMax now drops the per-message name from user-role messages. Point the config.example MiniMax models at PatchedChatMiniMax so they also get reasoning_content mapping.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat(image-generation): MiniMax sends JSON prompt field, guard 1500-char limit

MiniMax image-01 takes one text string capped at 1500 chars, but the skill was sending the whole structured JSON. The MiniMax provider now extracts the JSON `prompt` field (relying on prompt_optimizer to expand it) and fails fast with a clear error before calling the API when that field exceeds 1500 chars. Authoring stays provider-agnostic; Gemini still receives the full JSON.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* feat(podcast-generation): per-provider TTS concurrency and retry/backoff

Each TTS provider owns its concurrency internally — MiniMax runs single-threaded to reduce rate-limit failures, Volcengine keeps 4 workers — with automatic retry and backoff on transient HTTP and base_resp errors. No caller-facing concurrency knob.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(skills): address Copilot review comments on generation skills

- video: add raise_for_status + timeout to the Gemini download/POST/poll calls so non-2xx responses surface as clear HTTP errors instead of JSON/KeyError or hangs
- video: check the task Fail status before the generic base_resp check so the failure keeps its task_id context
- video/image: create the output file parent directory before writing (matching music-generation) so nested output paths do not raise FileNotFoundError
- music: require a non-empty prompt and fail fast with ValueError instead of sending an empty prompt to the API

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(scripts): reclaim dev ports across worktrees in make stop/dev

All deer-flow worktrees (main checkout + linked worktrees) hardcode the same dev ports (8001/3000/2026), so a service started from any worktree must be reclaimable from another. stop_all now resolves the set of worktree roots (DEERFLOW_ROOTS) and treats a process as deer-flow-owned when its open files live under any of them. It also force-kills survivors on 2026 alongside 8001/3000, fixing `make dev` aborting on the nginx port preflight when a prior nginx lingered on 2026.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(view-image): hide the injected image-context message from the UI

ViewImageMiddleware injects a HumanMessage (text + base64 images) so the vision model can see viewed images, but it was the only internal injector that set neither hide_from_ui nor a hidden name, so it leaked into the chat UI (and IM channels) as a user bubble reading "Here are the images you've viewed:". Mark it with additional_kwargs={"hide_from_ui": True}, matching todo/dynamic_context injections, which the frontend isHiddenFromUIMessage and the channel sender already honor. The model still receives the full content.

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

* fix(minimax): mark M2.7 models as text-only (no vision)

MiniMax M2.7 / M2.7-highspeed do not support vision; only M3 does. The
provider config asserted vision support for M2.7 in four places.

- config.example.yaml: 4 M2.7 entries -> supports_vision: false
- backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md: M2.7 + highspeed -> supports_vision: false
- wizard: add LLMProvider.model_vision_overrides + extra_config_for() so
 selecting an M2.7 model writes supports_vision: false while M3 (default)
 keeps vision; wire it through setup_wizard.py
- tests: M2.7-highspeed fixture -> supports_vision=False; add
 test_minimax_vision_is_per_model

* fix(scripts): reclaim dev ports across worktrees in make stop/dev

All deer-flow worktrees (main checkout + linked worktrees) hardcode the same dev ports (8001/3000/2026), so a service started from any worktree must be reclaimable from another. stop_all now resolves the set of worktree roots (DEERFLOW_ROOTS) and treats a process as deer-flow-owned when its open files live under any of them. It also force-kills survivors on 2026 alongside 8001/3000, fixing `make dev` aborting on the nginx port preflight when a prior nginx lingered on 2026.

* fix(view-image): hide the injected image-context message from the UI

ViewImageMiddleware injects a HumanMessage (text + base64 images) so the vision model can see viewed images, but it was the only internal injector that set neither hide_from_ui nor a hidden name, so it leaked into the chat UI (and IM channels) as a user bubble reading "Here are the images you've viewed:". Mark it with additional_kwargs={"hide_from_ui": True}, matching todo/dynamic_context injections, which the frontend isHiddenFromUIMessage and the channel sender already honor. The model still receives the full content.

* fix(minimax): mark M2.7 models as text-only (no vision)

MiniMax M2.7 / M2.7-highspeed do not support vision; only M3 does. The
provider config asserted vision support for M2.7 in four places.

- config.example.yaml: 4 M2.7 entries -> supports_vision: false
- backend/docs/CONFIGURATION.md: M2.7 + highspeed -> supports_vision: false
- wizard: add LLMProvider.model_vision_overrides + extra_config_for() so
 selecting an M2.7 model writes supports_vision: false while M3 (default)
 keeps vision; wire it through setup_wizard.py
- tests: M2.7-highspeed fixture -> supports_vision=False; add
 test_minimax_vision_is_per_model

* fix(models): strip inconsistent user-message names for MiniMax chat

DeerFlow middlewares tag user messages with provenance names (user-input, summary, loop_warning); langchain serializes them into the OpenAI-compatible payload and MiniMax rejects mismatched user-message names with "user name must be consistent (2013)". PatchedChatMiniMax now drops the per-message name from user-role messages. Point the config.example MiniMax models at PatchedChatMiniMax so they also get reasoning_content mapping.

* feat(image-generation): MiniMax sends JSON prompt field, guard 1500-char limit

MiniMax image-01 takes one text string capped at 1500 chars, but the skill was sending the whole structured JSON. The MiniMax provider now extracts the JSON `prompt` field (relying on prompt_optimizer to expand it) and fails fast with a clear error before calling the API when that field exceeds 1500 chars. Authoring stays provider-agnostic; Gemini still receives the full JSON.

* feat(podcast-generation): per-provider TTS concurrency and retry/backoff

Each TTS provider owns its concurrency internally — MiniMax runs single-threaded to reduce rate-limit failures, Volcengine keeps 4 workers — with automatic retry and backoff on transient HTTP and base_resp errors. No caller-facing concurrency knob.

* fix(skills): address Copilot review comments on generation skills

- video: add raise_for_status + timeout to the Gemini download/POST/poll calls so non-2xx responses surface as clear HTTP errors instead of JSON/KeyError or hangs
- video: check the task Fail status before the generic base_resp check so the failure keeps its task_id context
- video/image: create the output file parent directory before writing (matching music-generation) so nested output paths do not raise FileNotFoundError
- music: require a non-empty prompt and fail fast with ValueError instead of sending an empty prompt to the API
